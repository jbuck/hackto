TinEye Image Compositor
=======================

The TEIC is a prototype image compositor that Jon Buckley (@jbuck) 
Scott Downe (@ScottDowne), Matthew Schranz (@mjschranz), David
Seifried (@dseif) built for HackTO, the Toronto event of
[HackDays](http://hackdays.ca/).

If you want to try it out (assuming the TinEye API endpoint is still
active), make sure you have node v0.6.x installed and do the following:

1. `git clone https://github.com/jbuck/hackto.git`
2. `cd hackto`
3. `npm install`
4. `node server.js`
5. Visit http://localhost:8888 in Firefox (sorry, doesn't work in anything else)
